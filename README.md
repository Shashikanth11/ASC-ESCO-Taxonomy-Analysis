# ASC/ESCO Taxonomy Analysis
The **Australian Skills Classification (ASC) 2024 dataset** provides a structured taxonomy of occupations and skills relevant to the Australian job market.To understand it strength and weakness this project performs a detailed **text analysis** with various **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**, including **word frequency analysis, n-gram analysis, topic modeling, clustering, and similarity analysis**.


After analyzing the ASC dataset, this project also **compares it with the European Skills Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy** to find similarities and differences in skill representation between the two classification systems. By leveraging **text similarity techniques** such as TF-IDF and **embedding-based models** (e.g., BERT), we identify gaps and overlaps between Australian and European occupational taxonomies.  

The insights from this study will help in understanding:
- The **strengths and limitations** of the ASC taxonomy.  
- Key **trends in job descriptions** and skill distributions.  
- How **occupational classifications** differ across regions.  
- The **impact of AI and automation** on future skill requirements.  

This analysis provides valuable findings for **Students, educators, and workforce planners** to find the developing skills and demands, which will help them to improve their chances of securing a job in this evolving job market.
